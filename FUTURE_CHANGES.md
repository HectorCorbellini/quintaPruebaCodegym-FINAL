# Future Improvements - Environment Separation

## Issue: Port Configuration
Current Implementation:
- Both production and development environments use port 8080
- This can cause conflicts when running multiple environments

## Recommended Change: Separate Ports for Environments

### Benefits:
1. **Simultaneous Running**
   - Ability to run both environments at the same time
   - Facilitates side-by-side comparison of behavior
   - Useful for debugging environment-specific issues

2. **Clear Environment Identification**
   - Port number immediately indicates which environment is being accessed
   - Reduces confusion when switching between environments
   - Easier to identify environment in logs and error reports

3. **Prevents Accidental Interference**
   - No risk of one environment stopping the other
   - Eliminates port conflicts
   - Provides cleaner separation of concerns

### Implementation Steps:
1. Update application-dev.yaml to use port 8081
2. Modify dev_run.sh and dev_stop.sh to reference port 8081
3. Update all_setup.sh to properly clean up both ports
4. Update documentation to reflect this change

### Priority: Medium
This change is not critical but would improve developer experience and environment management.

## Run Script Improvements

### Current Issues:
- Scripts lack proper error handling for application startup failures
- No clear indication of application URL after startup
- No health check to verify application is fully operational
- Difficult to distinguish between database and application issues
- No graceful shutdown mechanism

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Enhanced Startup Feedback**
   - Add clear messaging about the application URL (http://localhost:8080)
   - Display environment-specific information (PROD vs DEV)
   - Show a startup progress indicator

2. **Health Check Integration**
   - Add a health check after startup to verify the application is responding
   - Implement timeout and retry logic for startup verification
   - Provide clear error messages for common failure scenarios

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Add specific error codes for different failure types
   - Implement logging with timestamps and error context
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common errors

4. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - Capture SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
   - Implement proper application shutdown sequence
   - Add cleanup for temporary resources

### Priority: High
These improvements would significantly enhance the developer experience and reduce troubleshooting time.

## Code Quality Analysis

### Static Code Analysis
- Use tools like SonarQube or PMD to identify:
  - Unused methods, fields, and classes
  - Duplicate code blocks that could be refactored
  - Code style violations
  - Potential bugs and security vulnerabilities

### Dependency Analysis
- Review pom.xml for:
  - Unused dependencies
  - Duplicate dependencies
  - Outdated dependencies
  - Dependencies that serve the same purpose

### Test Coverage Analysis
- Use JaCoCo or similar tools to:
  - Generate coverage reports
  - Identify untested code
  - Find redundant test cases
  - Measure overall test coverage

### Priority: High
This analysis is crucial for maintaining code quality and reducing technical debt.

## Completed Improvements

### Script Exit Strategy (Completed)
- Fixed incorrect exit codes in dev_run.sh and prod_run.sh
- Removed unconditional exit 1 at the end of scripts
- Added proper completion messages

### Shell Script Refactoring (Completed)
- Created a common shell library (scripts/common.sh)
- Extracted duplicated functions into reusable components:
  - Prerequisite checking
  - Container cleanup
  - Database verification
  - Port cleanup
  - Application building and running
- Updated all scripts to use the common library
- Improved maintainability and reduced duplication

### Next Steps
- Implement improved error handling and logging
- Reorganize code structure
- Enhance database migration strategy
